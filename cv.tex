\section{Relevant Professional Experience}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{11.2cm}}
  \emph{Current} \\
  \textsc{Jun '12 - now} & Chief Technology Officer at \textsc{My Local Planet}\\
                         &\emph{A Local News Portal}\\
                         &\footnotesize{Working with the C.E.O, we've taken \href{www.mylocalplanet.com}{www.mylocalplanet.com}
  from prototype to launch. The application is composed of two Rails apps, a couple of Sinatra apps
  and it runs on one Virtual Private Server and one physical server. We have doing less development
  of late as we experiment with S.E.O in order to drive traffic to the site.}
  \\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
  \textsc{Sep '13 - Oct '13} & Freelance Rails Development for \textsc{TownhouseHQ} \\
                             &\emph{Bespoke Content Management System}\\
                             &\footnotesize{TownhouseHQ are a digital design agency. They needed my help
  creating C.R.M \& Blogging app with a few unusual requirements. Built with Ruby on Rails \& the
  beautifully named “Comfortable Mexican Sofa” gem.}\\
                             &\emph{Pluggr API}\\
                             &\footnotesize{ I helped design and implement the API for a video
  microblogging site due to launch April 2013. }

\section{Relevant Professional Experience Continued}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{11.2cm}}
  \textsc{Dec '12 - Jan '13} & Freelance Rails Development \textsc{PDFem} \\
                             &\emph{Turns your emails into PDF files}\\
                             &\footnotesize{This app will take any email you send it, convert it into a PDF
  file, then put it in your Dropbox. I leveraged a variety of open source projects to build and
  deliver this very quickly, including: Dovecot, Postfix, mailman Rails, Omniauth, Rspec \&
  wkhtmltopdf. The client was non technical and couldn't maintain the application, so I ensured the
  Rails was (I hope) bug free and the mail server component would deliver 100\% uptime.}
  \\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
  \textsc{Jun '12 - Jul '12} & Freelance Rails Development \textsc{Bike Share Philly} \\
                             &\emph{Where do you need a public bike shed?}\\
                             &\footnotesize{This app was a clone of the official Bike Share Philadelphia
  app with a few extra features. The client was reluctant to explain why Philly needed two near
  identical bike sharing apps. Users see a map, and place pins on places they want the City
  Council to build a pubic bicycle shed. It was built using Shareabouts.}
  \\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
  \textsc{Dec '10 - Sep '11} & Rails Developer \textsc{Quipper} \\
                             &\emph{A Quiz Entry System}\\
                             &\footnotesize{Quipper focus on educating with quizzes. I wrote the
  part that allows anyone to enter a Quiz one question at a time. There is also a Backend, an
  iPhone app and an Android App. I also wrote a service that takes a Quiz (as json), and turns it into
  a packaged Android app, but must credit the C.T.O who built the prototype of this component. We
  used a plethora of technologies including Google's App Engine, Heroku \& MongoDB.}
  \\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
  \textsc{Oct '10 - Dec '10} & Co-Founder \& Rails Developer \textsc{Tune Into Me} \\
                             &\emph{Sell music painlessly.}\\
                             &\footnotesize{Tune Into Me was a site where amateur musicians could create a web
  page to sell their music very easily. I built it in Rails with Rspec \& Cucumber and it was cloud hosted
  on Heroku \& S3. The project was abandoned after my partner lost faith in the concept and reneged on
  our agreement. That space is now filled by bandcamp.com who came to the market late with the same
  idea, and now have revenues of about \$2.4 million every 30 days.}

  \textsc{Oct '10 - Jan '11} & Freelance Rails Development \textsc{Timeline Maker} \\
                             &\emph{A web application to make timeline charts}\\
                             &\footnotesize{ I was commissioned by a front end developer to make an app for
  producing timeline charts. We started off with MITs SIMILE Timeline widget for the front end, and a Rails
  back end. The client pitched in with some CSS \& Javascript once I got the basic funtionality up and
  running. }
  \\\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\
  \textsc{Mar '10 - Oct '10} & C\# Developer \textsc{Retail Human Factors} \\
                             &\emph{Discrete Event Simulation - A computer model of a supermarket}\\
                             &\footnotesize{ Supermarkets spend upwards of \pounds250,000 to try a
  new technology (like a new way for customers to pay, or a new type of checkout). Many times these
  new technologies turn out to be not-so-great. We made computer models of a supermarket so we could
  test new technologies out using that. We can see how the new technology affects queues and profits
  without having to rip a real store to bits.}

Aside from my interest in tech I also enjoy playing guitar, cycling, tennis, chess, and
playing piano. I'm barbecue mad, and even have a few during the colder months. \\
